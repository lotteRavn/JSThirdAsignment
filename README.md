Assignment JS.Arrays.1
In the assignments Conds.0, and Funcs.2, you were flipping a coin of rolling a die. In both cases you used counter variables to tally the number of the various outcomes. Now you must change that to using an array instead of individual variables. Write a comment or two about it in the code.

Hand in as a file called jsArrays1.js
